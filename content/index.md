### The NYC Gathering on Climate, the Environment, and Ecology


This is an open gathering/meeting on **December 13-17** in local New
York City parks and outdoor spaces.

Anyone in the New York City area who is interested in climate, the
environment, and/or ecology is welcome to attend for as much or as
little of the gathering as they would like. **To attend, please email
Adam Massmann at akm2203@columbia.edu.**

### Motivation

Somewhere to discuss and engage with climate and/or ecology that:

  * is local to the NYC area, avoiding long distance travel and its
    energy/carbon costs for people living nearby.
  * is in-person.
  * is in an outdoor space, reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread while
    grounding the gathering in local NYC ecologies.
  * free to attend (no registration or funding required).
  * builds knowledge through discussion and community; does not
    require formal preparation or scientific "production" (abstract
    submission, oral/poster presentations, etc.).

### Potential locales (ideas and feedback welcome)

  * Van Cortlandt Park
  * Fort Tryon and Inwood Parks
  * Flushing Meadows Corona Park and Queens Botanical Garden
  * Central Park
  * Prospect Park
  * Rockaway Beach/Fort Tilden/Jacob Riis
  * Snug Harbor
  * Great Kills park

More details will be posted to this website as the
attendees/organizers finalize them. If you have any questions or would
like to be added to the gathering's mailing list, please email Adam
Massmann at akm2203@columbia.edu

### Inspiration

This gathering's format is inspired by the American Society for
Theater Research's [Ecology and Performance Working
Group](https://www.astr.org/page/21_WorkingSessions#9).
