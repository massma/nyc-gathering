### The NYC Gathering on Climate, the Environment, and Ecology


This is an open gathering/meeting on **December 13-17** in local New
York City parks and outdoor spaces.

Anyone in the New York City area who is interested in climate, the
environment, and/or ecology is welcome to attend for as much or as
little gathering as they would like. To attend, please email Adam
Massmann at akm2203@columbia.edu.

### Gathering motivation

We wanted somewhere to discuss and engage with global/local climate
and/or ecology that:

  * Does not require long distance travel (with associated
    carbon/energy costs) for people local to the NYC area.
  * Does not require digital conferencing tools (Zoom, etc.).
  * Does not require scientific production or intensive preparation
    (abstract submission, presentations, posters, etc.).
  * Does not require a registration fee.
  * Does not require sharing an indoor space with others.

### Potential locales (ideas welcome)

  * Van Cortlandt Park
  * Fort Tryon and Inwood Parks
  * Flushing Meadows Corona Park and Queens Botanical Garden
  * Central Park
  * Prospect Park
  * Rockaway Beach/Fort Tilden/Jacob Riis
  * Snug Harbor
  * Great Kills park

More details will be posted to this website as the
attendees/organizers finalize them. If you have any questions or would
like to be added to the gathering's mailing list, please email Adam
Massmann at akm2203@columbia.edu
