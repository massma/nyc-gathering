### The NYC Gathering on Climate, the Environment, and Ecology


This is an open gathering/meeting on **December 13-17** in local New
York City parks and outdoor spaces.

Anyone in the New York City area who is interested in climate, the
environment, and/or ecology is welcome to attend for as much or as
little of the gathering as they would like. **To attend, please email
Adam Massmann at akm2203@columbia.edu.**

### Motivation

Somewhere to discuss and engage with climate and/or ecology that:

  * Does not require long distance travel, with its associated
    energy/carbon costs, for people local to the NYC area.
  * Does not require digital conferencing tools (Zoom, etc.).
  * Does not require intensive preparation or scientific "production"
    (abstract submission, presentations, posters, etc.).
  * Does not require a registration fee.
  * is in an outdoor space.

### Potential locales (ideas and feedback welcome)

  * Van Cortlandt Park
  * Fort Tryon and Inwood Parks
  * Flushing Meadows Corona Park and Queens Botanical Garden
  * Central Park
  * Prospect Park
  * Rockaway Beach/Fort Tilden/Jacob Riis
  * Snug Harbor
  * Great Kills park

More details will be posted to this website as the
attendees/organizers finalize them. If you have any questions or would
like to be added to the gathering's mailing list, please email Adam
Massmann at akm2203@columbia.edu

### Inspiration

This gathering's format is inspired by the Ecology and Performance
Working Group's approach for the American Society for Theater Research
conference.
